# Do Data Matter for Air Quality? New Evidence from Machine Learning Predictions

__joint with Minghao Qiu (MIT)__

Does providing credible public information on environmental hazards incentivize local government to comply with regulations and improve environmental quality? This question is difficult to answer with traditional administrative and survey data because researchers usually lack access to credible environmental data before these information treatments were administered, making it impossible to select appropriate control groups and compare pre-treatment trends. We leverage recent development in machine learning techniques and a rich set of satellite images from NASA and reconstructed a comprehensive air pollution dataset in China, where previous official data were shown to be manipulated. We exploit variation in a large natural experiment from 2012 to 2015 in China, when cities started monitoring and disclosing air pollution information at different times. With an event study design, we test for the hypothesis that the (semi-)mandatory reporting of PM2.5 data improves air quality in treated cities. We find null effects of this policy with tight confidence intervals around zero, indicating that the information treatment is insufficient to yield large changes in air quality. This study has important implications for recent investments in building the national monitoring network in China.
